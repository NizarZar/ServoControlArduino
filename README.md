### Components:
- Arduino UNO R3
- HC-05 bluetooth module
- KY-008 Laser Module
- 2 SG90 servos with pan tilt
### Windows App:
- This arduino code of servo can be controlled using my [ServoControlApp](https://github.com/NizarZar/ServoWinFormsApp) made in C# WinForms.

### Demonstration:
- I have made a small demonstration video that can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/00nqciE0ZA8)

### What's next ?
- I am planning to switch to STM32 or ESP32 and switch to WiFi communication instead of Bluetooth.
- Add a camera that can be seen from the ServoControlApp.
- Add an ultrasonic detection sensor to use this as a security camera measure.
